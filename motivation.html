<h4>creative, unpolished work</h4>

<p>A format that I am leaning towards is screencasts because I am interested in capturing problem-solving in real-time.
More accurately, the nature of data and coding work will mostly be overcoming a series of technical trivialities. I expect there to be, however, 
a somewhat surprising amount of appeal in observing the creative process due to the unappreciated art that is mixed in with the science, in the nature of it.</p>

<p>Ideally, we would also get a sense of the thought process of the individual as they struggle and muddle through. 
After experimenting with the screencast format,  I have
settled on an interspersed mix of commentary and coding. Although I would have liked to have adopted the format favoured by George Hotz,
where the individual narrates and works at the same time, this was abandoned due to its surprising difficulty - particularly as I am not directly interacting with an audience such as through twitch or youtube.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>documentation &amp; discipline</h4>

<p>In addition to being a mechanism for sharing my exploratory work, this blog also serves as both documention and a form of discipline. 
Having a public open forum will focus my attention and encourage me to write up tidbits of information.
The data and coding artifacts I create will also serve as documentation, and will hopefully help and inspire others.
