### Revisiting NBA player data - via nba_api

I’m starting to pull together some player data for the NBA 2021/22
season, and have started with the Nets. I didn’t really follow the last
season that closely, and thought that plotting a heatmap of minutes
played, sorted by total minutes played, might be a handy way to
presenting a summary of a season.
