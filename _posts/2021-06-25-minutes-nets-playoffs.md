This notebook shows the minutes played by starters and bench Nets players in their two playoff series.

The hypothesis for looking at minutes played is that: did the cumulative effect of the number of minutes played by K. Durant lead to his fatigue
(which could be measured by something like shooting percentage) in game 7 of the second series?

This analysis only looks on the minutes played side of the relationship, whereas a measure of player performance would also be required to answer the question of fatigue.
